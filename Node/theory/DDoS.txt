DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service. DDoS is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often infected with a Trojan, 
are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems 
maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack.In a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different 
sources – potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very 
difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.

The Difference Between DoS and DDos Attacks
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is different from a DDoS attack. The DoS attack typically uses one computer and one Internet connection to flood a targeted
 system or resource. The DDoS attack uses multiple computers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource. DDoS attacks are often global attacks, 
distributed via botnets.

Types of DDoS Attacks
There are many types of DDoS attacks. Common attacks include the following:

Traffic attacks: Traffic flooding attacks send a huge volume of TCP, UDP and ICPM packets to the target. Legitimate requests get lost and these attacks may
 be accompanied by malware exploitation.
Bandwidth attacks: This DDos attack overloads the target with massive amounts of junk data. This results in a loss 
of network bandwidth and equipment resources and can lead to a complete denial of service.
Application attacks: Application-layer data messages can deplete 
resources in the application layer, leaving the target's system services unavailable.

process for mitigating a DDoS attacks:

	Black Hole Routing
	Rate Limiting
	Web Application Firewall
