Representational State Transfer (REST) -
			It is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web services that 
conform to the REST architectural style, termed RESTful web services.In REST, primary data representation is called Resource.REST APIs use Uniform 
Resource

 Identifiers (URIs) to address resources.

REST Resource Naming Best Practices:
		Use nouns to represent resources
		RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing (noun) instead of referring to an action (verb) because nouns have properties
		 which verbs do not have – similar to resources have attributes. Some examples of a resource are:

collection:
	A collection resource is a server-managed directory of resources. Clients may propose new resources to be added to a collection.

store:
	A store is a client-managed resource repository. A store resource lets an API client put resources in, get them back out, and decide when to delete them.
 A store never generates new URIs. Instead, each stored resource has a URI that was chosen by a client when it was initially put into the store.

documentation

Use forward slash (/) to indicate a hierarchical relationships

Use lowercase letters in URIs

Use query component to filter URI collection

Do not use trailing forward slash (/) in URIs

Do not use underscores ( _ )

Do not use file extenstions

Never use CRUD function names in URIs
